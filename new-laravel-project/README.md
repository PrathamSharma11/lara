TASK = 
Create a very simple Laravel web application for task management:

1)Create task (info to save: task name, priority, timestamps)
2)Edit task
3)Delete task
4)Reorder tasks with drag and drop in the browser. Priority should automatically be updated based on this. #1 priority goes at top, #2 next down and so on.
Tasks should be saved to a mysql table.
BONUS POINT: add project functionality to the tasks. User should be able to select a project from a dropdown and only view tasks associated with that project.
